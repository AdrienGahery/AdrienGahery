## GeoSpatial DataScience

I've been learning SQL the hard way, as I took part in setting up a geographical information system from the ground up: gathering available data, creating a catalog, streamlining data into our standards, setting up a PostGIS database, letting the whole French Public Office in French Guiana (DGTM) I'm part of benefit from it. This great endeavour provided me with a precious experience in soft skills as well as in hard ones, such as the aforementionned SQL.

Now that I'm on a professionnal leave, I'm willing to expand my knowledge towards GeoSpatial DataScience. I'm looking to collaborate on Research projects. To feature my skillset, I chose the the Jupyter Notebook format, which is popular in that field.

I want to pick the best out of Geographical Information Systems and Data Science: capabilities in database managment, and statistical/Machine Learning treatments. I'm currently setting a [repository](https://github.com/AdrienGahery/GIS-DataScience_Pipeline) focused on using Data Science tools with PostGIS-hosted geographical data. 

I've been using R for statistics and spatial analysis during the year of study I took in the University of Grenoble, France. Since I've been discovering Python that very year and it's popular in various applications, I decided I'd give a go to Python spatial analysis libraries.

The repository is currently a WIP, I'm continuously learning from Notebook to Notebook. Here is a list of the ressources I'm using for the project I'm sharing on GitHub :
