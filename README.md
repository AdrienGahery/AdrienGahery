## GeoSpatial DataScience

I have been learning SQL and spatial SQL the hard way, as I took part in setting up a geographical information system from the ground up: gathering available data, creating a catalog, streamlining data into our standards, setting up a PostGIS database, letting the whole French Public Office in French Guiana (DGTM) I was part of benefit from it. This great endeavour also provided me with a precious experience in soft skills, such as network animation and pedagogy.

Now that I am on a professionnal leave, I am willing to expand my knowledge towards GeoSpatial DataScience. I am looking to collaborate on Research projects.

I have been using R for statistics and spatial analysis during the year of study I took in the University of Grenoble, France. Since I have been discovering Python that very year and it is popular in various applications, I decided I would give a go at Python spatial analysis libraries.

Using Python, I want to pick the best out of Geographical Information Systems and Data Science: capabilities in database managment, and Data Mining/Machine Learning treatments. I am currently setting a repository focused on using Data Science tools with PostGIS geographical data. 

The repository is currently a Work In Progress, as I am continuously learning from Notebook to Notebook. Here is a list of the ressources I am using for the project I am sharing on GitHub :
