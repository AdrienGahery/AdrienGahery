## Adrien Gahéry

I'm willing to expand my knowledge towards Geo Spatial DataScience. Since the core of my job is SQL-based, and I'm interested in Data Science for my field, I want to pick the best out of both world: capabilities in database managment, and complex treatments&calculations. I'm currently setting a [repository](https://github.com/AdrienGahery/GIS-DataScience_Pipeline) focused on Geographical Data Science, bridging both worlds.
