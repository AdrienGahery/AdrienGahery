## Adrien Gah√©ry

The core of my job is SQL-based. I've been learning it the hard way, as I took part in setting up a geographical information system from the ground up: gathering available data, setting a catalog, streamlining this data into our standards, setting up a PostGIS server and its architecture, promoting GIS for the benefit of our whole French Public Office in French Guiana (DGTM).

Now that I'm on a professionnal leave, I'm willing to expand my knowledge towards GeoSpatial DataScience. I'm looking to collaborate on Research projects, hence the Jupyter Notebook format which is popular in that field.

I want to pick the best out of Geographical Information Systems and Data Science: capabilities in database managment, and complex treatments & calculations. I'm currently setting a [repository](https://github.com/AdrienGahery/GIS-DataScience_Pipeline) focused on Geographical Data Science, bridging both worlds. 

I've been using R for that application during the year-long course I undertook in the University of Grenoble, France. Since I've been discovering Python that very year and it's popular in various applications, I decided I'd give a go to Python spatial analysis libraries. 

The repository is currently a WIP, I'm learning new stuff as I go. Here is a list of the ressources I'm using for that project :
